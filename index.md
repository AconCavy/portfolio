## About

- Name: Takuro Magaki
- Handle: AconCavy
- Twitter: [@AconCavy](https://twitter.com/AconCavy)
- Interest: VR/AR/xR, Game Development

I am good at developing games and simulators mainly using C# and Unity as an IT engineer.
And, as a researcher, I had been researched that forecasting cybersickness (aka Virtual Reality sickness) using physiological data in Virtual Reality in Future University Hakodate, Japan.
I am interested in game developments and realizing new life experiences using xR technology.
Please contact me via a direct message on Twitter if you are interested.

### [Cybatica](https://github.com/AconCavy/Cybatica) (2019)

The mobile application named Cybatica was developed using Xamarin.Forms in the master's research. Cybatica connects with the [Empatica E4](https://www.empatica.com/en-gb/research/e4/) to forecast and monitor cybersickness using physiological data (HRV and EDA) in the realtime.
