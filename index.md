I am good at developing games and simulators mainly using C# and Unity as an IT engineer.
And, as a researcher, I had been researched that forecasting cybersickness (aka Virtual Reality sickness) using physiological data in Virtual Reality in Future University Hakodate, Japan.
I am interested in game developments and realizing new life experiences using xR technology.
Please contact me via a direct message on Twitter if you are interested.

## Works

### [devcontainer-latex](https://github.com/AconCavy/devcontainer-latex) (2021)

The repository is a template repository of latex workspace to work on the vscode devcontainer.
### [Mulinq](https://github.com/AconCavy/Mulinq) (2021)

The library is C# LINQ extensions for collections and multidimensional arrays. A package of the library is published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Mulinq). A unit testing, linting, and release of the package that have been managed by GitHub Actions in the repository of the library.

### [CompetitiveProgrammingTemplateCSharp](https://github.com/AconCavy/CompetitiveProgrammingTemplateCSharp) (2020)

The template is dotnet cli template for competitive programming using C#. The template will provide a tasks and tests projects, a solver class item, and a test class item.
It is blogged [here](https://aconcavy.github.io/Blog/posts/20201129dotnettemplate). (Japanese)

### [sandbox-csharp](https://github.com/AconCavy/sandbox-csharp) (2020-)

The project is testing and benchmarking an experimental C# functions as a sandbox.

### [SnippetBuilder](https://github.com/AconCavy/SnippetBuilder) (2020)

The application is building editor's snippets files for competitive programming library etc.

### [algorithm-csharp](https://github.com/AconCavy/algorithm-csharp) (2020)

The library is an algorithm library for competitive programming contests. It is based on [ac-library](https://github.com/atcoder/ac-library) written by C#, which some additional classes. 

### [Forty Five](https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/ffxlv-1) (2020)

The game named Forty Five that attacks from the 45 degrees to repair things was developed in the Global Game Jam 2020.

### [Cybatica](https://github.com/AconCavy/Cybatica) (2019)

The mobile application named Cybatica was developed using Xamarin.Forms in the master's research. Cybatica connects with the [Empatica E4](https://www.empatica.com/research/e4/) to forecast and monitor cybersickness using physiological data (HRV and EDA) in the realtime.
